# App-Reviews
Research Background :

In my internship, I have previously worked on the Know More User (KMU) project which aims to find out the needs and constraints regarding the use of the application through interviews via chat, but the customers who conducted the interviews were limited so that only a little review data was obtained. Therefore, more review data is needed to find out accurate and comprehensive reviews of application performance.

Method :

Analysis steps :
1)	Data collecting
2)	Data cleaning
3)	Classification data
4)	Visualization data

Result :

Based on the analysis results obtained, the Bangbeli application on Google Play consists of 1105 positive reviews and 96 negative reviews as of June 17, 2023. From the user's point of view, Bangbeli can help in making digital transactions because the application is easy to use and the products have affordable prices. Some things that need to be improved are in terms of replenishing the balance, which sometimes still takes a long time and the response of customer service, which is actually friendly but feels a little unsatisfactory in dealing with existing problems.
